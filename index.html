    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.
      </li>

      const article = `Silicon is often associated with technology, semiconductors, the industry, wafers, computers, chips, and electronics. It is widely used in solar power, particularly in Silicon Valley, and other photovoltaic applications. Silicon is also an important component in the manufacturing of high-tech products such as microchips, integrated circuits, and processors.

In addition, silicon is often paired with other words such as doping, lithography, nanotechnology, and polysilicon. It is a vital material in the production of electronic devices, and its electrical conductivity and density make it a popular choice for industrial and research applications.

Silicon is made up of atoms and molecules, and it is typically found in the form of quartz or as silicon dioxide. The production of silicon involves the processing of sand and the creation of ingots, which are then used to create a variety of electronic components. The properties of silicon make it an ideal material for a wide range of technological and scientific applications, and it continues to be an essential element in the development of new innovations and technologies`;
